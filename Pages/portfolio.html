                        I have always wanted to build an emulator of some sort, especially a PS1 emulator, however, writing a PS1 emulator is very time-consuming, so I decided to choose a simpler emulator to gain more experience in writing emulators and then go back to the PS1 emulator.
                        <br><br>
                        I mainly started this project for fun, however, I wanted to improve my knowledge of system programming.
                        <br><br>
                        The emulator still contains some missing futures such as the Audio and some issues with the PPU to solve.
                        <br><br>
                        While making the Game Boy emulator, I have encountered many issues, some took days or even weeks to solve!<br>
                        However, I have enjoyed every bit of problem-solving it brought.
                        <br><br>
                        The development of this emulator is far from finished and my main goal is to have support for more games, such as the Pok√©mon games.
                        <br><br>
                        In the future, after implementing those futures, I am planning to support the coloured version as well.

                        This is my first every emulator that I have worked on, and it isn't completed as it will take a very long time to complete it.
                        <br><br>
                        As this is my first emulator, I decided to follow a tutorial(a bad mistake) though I learnt so much from it!
                        <br><br>
                        It is obviously missing so many features however it has a fully functioning CPU, and as you can see, the rendering is really messed up!
                        <br><br>
                        My plan is once I finish the Game Boy emulator is to return and finish this emulator.
                        <br><br>
                        As you can probably see, one of the last futures I worked on was the VRAM and texture rendering, hence the random textures you may see on the screen.
                        <br><br>
                        It was so much fun writing this emulator and digging deeper into the world of emulators.

                        This is a runtime compiler that is based on C++ structure.
                        <br><br>
                        This compiler is nowhere near finished, but it has most of the fundamentals of a compiler.
                        <br><br>
                        When I say it isn't finished, I mean it in a way that as it's based on the structure of C++ and I wanted to add a lot of features, so it'll take a while.
                        <br><br>
                        The compiler has a Lexer, TAC, Semantic Analyser, CFG, IR and Code Generation.<br>
                        I originally wanted this compiler to be an interrupter, but then I switched to a compiler as I wanted to learn assembly.
                        <br><br>
                        The code generation is almost completely wrong, I'll admit, however, it was at a time when I barely knew assembly.
                        <br><br>
                        The code itself, isn't well-structured as when I started working on the Compiler I had little experience in writing cleaner code.

                        I started working on this game engine when I was 14, just a beginner that is interested in this field.
                        <br><br>
                        I worked on it for a year or so, and I learnt so much.<br>
                        I worked on so many projects using the game engine, such as, Raytracing, Minecraft clone to see how well my engine will handle a large number of objects.
                        <br><br>
                        and many different games especially a game called "RoboFactory", this game is a factory and I spent over 6 months working on it.
                        <br><br>
                        The game engine contain many different features and I wrote it using LWJGL in Java as it was the only language I knew at the time.
                        <br><br>
                        The engine has stuff like scenes loaders, audio, simple physics engine, a component system with saving,<br>
                        as well as its layout is quite like Unity where you have an inspector to view the script and any public fields.
                        <br><br>
                        I spent the most working on a scripting within the engine and the ability to compile at runtime.
                        <br><br>
                        There are also shaders that you can custom create using GLSL and in a material.
                        <br><br>
                        And of course you can load different projects into the game engine.
                        <br><br>
                        When I started University I had to abandon this project as I had little time to work on it, however,<br>
                        I am quite interested in how to make a Game Engine that supports many different platforms, which is my plan to work on in the future.
                        <br><br>
                        As I mentioned when I started this project, I was a beginner so the code base is structured in a very weird way.

                        I made this game for a Game Jam a very while ago.
                        <br><br>
                        It was my first time working with another person who was the artist.
                        <br><br>
                        The game idea is that you are a robot that has lost his memory chips so you need to go around a fetch them.
                        <br><br>
                        We used Unity to make this project and I can't remember what placement we got for the Game Jam.<br>
                        It obviously is quite bugged, but for an old project, it is really fun!
                        <br><br>
                        Everything you see there is made by me, most of the animations even but some of the Art was made by the Artist.
