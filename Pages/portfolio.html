                            I have always wanted to build an emulator of some sort, especially a PS1 emulator, however, writing a PS1 emulator is very time-consuming, so I decided to choose a simpler emulator to gain more experience in writing emulators and then go back to the PS1 emulator.
                            <br><br>
                            I mainly started this project for fun, however, I wanted to improve my knowledge of system programming.
                            <br><br>
                            The emulator still contains some missing futures such as the Audio and some issues with the PPU to solve.
                            <br><br>
                            While making the Game Boy emulator, I have encountered many issues, some took days or even weeks to solve!<br>
                            However, I have enjoyed every bit of problem-solving it brought.
                            <br><br>
                            The development of this emulator is far from finished and my main goal is to have support for more games, such as the Pok√©mon games.
                            <br><br>
                            In the future, after implementing those futures, I am planning to support the coloured version as well.

                            This is my first ever emulator that I have worked on, and it isn't completed as it will take a very long time to complete it.
                            <br><br>
                            As this is my first emulator, I decided to follow a tutorial(a bad mistake) though I learnt so much from it!
                            <br><br>
                            It is obviously missing so many features however it has a fully functioning CPU, and as you can see, the rendering is really messed up!
                            <br><br>
                            My plan is once I finish the Game Boy emulator is to return and finish this emulator.
                            <br><br>
                            As you can probably see, one of the last futures I worked on was the VRAM and texture rendering, hence the random textures you may see on the screen.
                            <br><br>
                            It was so much fun writing this emulator and digging deeper into the world of emulators.

                            This is a runtime compiler that is based on C++ structure.
                            <br><br>
                            This compiler is nowhere near finished, but it has most of the fundamentals of a compiler.
                            <br><br>
                            When I say it isn't finished, I mean it in a way that as it's based on the structure of C++ and I wanted to add a lot of features, so it'll take a while.
                            <br><br>
                            The compiler has a Lexer, TAC, Semantic Analyser, CFG, IR and Code Generation.<br>
                            I originally wanted this compiler to be an interrupter, but then I switched to a compiler as I wanted to learn assembly.
                            <br><br>
                            The code generation is almost completely wrong, I'll admit, however, it was at a time when I barely knew assembly.
                            <br><br>
                            The code itself, isn't well-structured as when I started working on the Compiler I had little experience in writing cleaner code.

                            I started working on this game engine when I was 14, just a beginner that is interested in this field.
                            <br><br>
                            I worked on it for a year or so, and I learnt so much.<br>
                            I worked on so many projects using the game engine, such as, Raytracing, Minecraft clone to see how well my engine will handle a large number of objects.
                            <br><br>
                            and many different games especially a game called "RoboFactory", this game is a factory and a simulation game.
                            <br><br>
                            At the moment, I'm updating the engine as I believe the original architecture is awful, as I started working on it when I was a beginner.
                            <br><br>
                            I am looking to add new features and a new architecture to the engine as well as rewriting the rendering pipeline.

                            I made this game for a Game Jam a while ago.
                            <br><br>
                            My plan was to create a game where you are in control of a character and you can either fight with it or build a base.
                            <br><br>
                            I had a week to make it and while I didn‚Äôt finish, I did learn a lot from the experience.
                            <br><br>
                            I did everything from the engine to the assets that were used in the game.
                            <br><br>
                            I still want to return to this project and finish it as I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
